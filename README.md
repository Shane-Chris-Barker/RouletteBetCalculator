# RouletteBetCalculator
I created this little repo for a HND computing class to get some experience with GIT and the workflow.
Anyone is welcome to contribute but I do ask that the solving of bugs and issues only be carried out by aspiring or
student developers.

Im hoping this repo will allow the students that use it build up their commit history ahead of seeking employment, gain experience,
get a feel of collaborative code and get some code into a real project

:)
